# Dice Game

This repository contains code for a dice game that I created while coding along with Colt Steel as part of his _The Web Developer Bootcamp 2024_ from Udemy. The focus of this section is on designing components for React.

As I am currently learning Full Stack development, I am using Git to store these code along files for future reference and collaboration.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to it if you find it interesting! Thank you for visiting.
